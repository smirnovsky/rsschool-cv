# About myself:
I started my career as a dentist.
Two years ago I decided to switch to work in IT. Started with online courses, continued learning on my own. My first job was as a coder in a small WEB-studio dealing with advertising.

Layout was my main task. But this was not enough for me, and then I completely immersed myself in Front-end development.

My goal is not just to become a front-end developer. I want to become a highly qualified and sought-after specialist in the market.

My strengths:
The desire to learn something new.
Craving for learning.
Self-discipline.
Striving to achieve your goals.

const ExpensesFilter = (props) => {
    const dropdownChangeHandler = (event) => {
        props.oncChangeFilter(event.target.value);
    };
  return (
    <div className='expenses-filter'>
      <div className='expenses-filter__control'>
        <label>Filter by year</label>
        <select value={props.selected} onChange={dropdownChangeHandler}>
          <option value='2022'>2022</option>
          <option value='2021'>2021</option>
          <option value='2020'>2020</option>
          <option value='2019'>2019</option>
        </select>
      </div>
